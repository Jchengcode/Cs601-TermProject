                Hello and welcome! I'm Jacky Cheng, a curious mind at the intersection of technology and human behavior.
                Currently delving into the complexities of software engineering for my master's,
                I bring a unique perspective shaped by my undergraduate studies in economics and psychology.
                Though I wouldn't claim to have a knack for any one thing,
                I'm on a journey to meld my diverse academic background into something that can truly make a difference.
                This website serves as a chronicle of my adventures in code, culture, and the countless cuisines I encountered along the way.

                As a native New Yorker, my identity is a mosaic of the city's relentless energy and eclectic spirit.
                The Big Apple's blend of cutting-edge innovation and timeless tradition fuels my ambition and creativity.
                It's a place where the hustle is as much a part of you as the air you breathe,
                teaching me resilience and the art of finding calm within the chaos.
                Whether I’m coding away at a new app or unwinding in Central Park's embrace, New York's dynamic rhythm is the drumbeat to my life.

            <p class='about-text'>
                My life's philosophy is simple yet evolving: embrace the diverse, the complex, and the unknown. It's about appreciating the richness that different perspectives bring,
                whether it's understanding a user's needs in a software program or dissecting the intricacies of human motivation. With this website, I aim to share slices of my world—from musings on technology's latest trends to reflections on the human experience,
                all seen through the lens of a software engineer with a twist.
            </p>

                So I invite you on this exploration of bytes and beliefs.
                Whether you're into the technical nitty-gritty, the economic forces shaping our world, or the psychological underpinnings of it all,
                there’s something here for you. Explore my musings, share your thoughts, and let's decode the complexities of life together.
